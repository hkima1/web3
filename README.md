In this project, I designed an elegant frontend interface using React and Tailwind CSS, featuring a wallet for account selection and a transfer box for sending cryptocurrency. 
The system ensures robust security through signature verification and secure handling of private addresses. 
Additionally, I implemented CORS in Node.js to restrict interactions to this specific port only.
